To automate self-healing for daily app pool crashes on EC2 instances using Elastic Stack (Kibana) for monitoring and GitHub Actions for load balancer operations and server reboots, you can follow these general steps:

Monitor with Elastic Stack (Kibana):
Set up monitoring in your Elastic Stack to watch for daily app pool crashes on your EC2 instances. This could involve creating specific Kibana dashboards and alerts based on relevant metrics and logs.

Define Thresholds and Triggers:
Determine the thresholds for app pool crashes that warrant intervention. This could be based on the frequency of crashes, severity, impact on users, etc.

Create GitHub Actions Workflows:
Develop GitHub Actions workflows to respond to triggers identified in step 2. These workflows could include steps for:

Detecting app pool crashes by querying logs or metrics from Elastic Stack.
Initiating load balancer operations to reroute traffic away from affected instances.
Triggering server reboots or other remediation actions on the affected EC2 instances.
Implement Self-Healing Logic:
Within your GitHub Actions workflows, implement the logic to automatically respond to detected app pool crashes. This might involve:

Using AWS CLI or SDK within GitHub Actions to interact with your AWS infrastructure, including the load balancer and EC2 instances.
Implementing error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliability.
Testing and Validation:
Thoroughly test your automated self-healing workflows to ensure they behave as expected in various scenarios, including different types of app pool crashes and network conditions.

Monitoring and Iteration:
Continuously monitor the performance of your self-healing system and gather feedback from incidents. Iterate on your workflows to improve efficiency, reliability, and response times.

By following these steps, you can create a robust automated self-healing system for handling daily app pool crashes on your EC2 instances using Elastic Stack for monitoring and GitHub Actions for orchestration and remediation.
